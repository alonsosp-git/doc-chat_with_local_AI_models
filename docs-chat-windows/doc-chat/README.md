# Docs Chat — v2.0

Ask questions about your PDF and DOCX files using a local AI.
**100% free. No API key. No internet after setup. Runs entirely on your machine.**

---

## What This App Does

Docs Chat is a local web application that lets you have a conversation with your documents.

- Drop any PDF or DOCX files into a folder on your computer
- Open a browser and ask questions in plain English
- The app finds the most relevant parts of your documents and uses a local AI model to generate an answer
- Everything runs inside Docker on your own machine — your documents never leave your PC

**Use cases:**
- Summarize long PDF reports
- Ask questions about contracts, manuals, or research papers
- Extract key dates, names, or figures from documents
- Analyze technical documents without sending them to a cloud service

## Requirements

Only one thing needed: **Docker Desktop** (free)
- Windows: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
- Mac: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

## Setup — Windows PC (Lenovo M900)

### File structure
Extract the Windows zip to `C:\doc-chat\` so it looks like this:

```
C:\doc-chat\
├── start-windows.bat       ← double-click to run everything
├── Dockerfile
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── templates\
│   └── index.html
└── scripts\
    └── start.sh
```

### Steps

**1. Install Docker Desktop**
Download and install from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/

**2. Double-click `start-windows.bat`** (right-click → Run as Administrator)

The script will automatically:
- Check Docker is running (and start it if needed)
- Create `C:\pdfs\` folder for your documents
- Build the Docker image (3-5 minutes, first time only)
- Start the container
- Open your browser at http://localhost:5000

**3. Add your documents**
Copy your PDF and DOCX files to `C:\pdfs\`

**4. Click "Reload Documents" in the app sidebar**

**5. Start asking questions!**

### Starting/stopping after first setup
```cmd
docker start docs-chat     # Start (instant)
docker stop docs-chat      # Stop
docker logs -f docs-chat   # View logs
```

## Setup — Mac Mini M2

### File structure
Extract the Mac zip to your home folder `~/doc-chat/` so it looks like this:

```
~/doc-chat/
├── start-mac.sh            ← run this once to set up everything
├── Dockerfile
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── templates/
│   └── index.html
└── scripts/
    └── start.sh
```

### Steps

**1. Install Docker Desktop for Mac**
Download from https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/ (choose Apple Silicon)

**2. Open Terminal, navigate to the folder and run:**
```bash
cd ~/doc-chat
chmod +x start-mac.sh
./start-mac.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- Check Docker is running (and start it if needed)
- Create `~/pdfs/` folder for your documents
- Build the Docker image (3-5 minutes, first time only)
- Start the container
- Open your browser at http://localhost:5000

**3. Add your documents**
Copy your PDF and DOCX files to `~/pdfs/`

**4. Click "Reload Documents" in the app sidebar**

**5. Start asking questions!**

### Starting/stopping after first setup
```bash
docker start docs-chat     # Start (instant)
docker stop docs-chat      # Stop
docker logs -f docs-chat   # View logs
```

## AI Models

The app comes with a built-in **Model Manager** (click "Manage" in the sidebar).

### Default model
`llama3.2:1b` — fastest option, recommended for Windows PC

### Recommended models per machine

| Model | Size | Speed | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| `llama3.2:1b` | 0.7 GB | ⚡ Fastest | Windows PC — quick Q&A |
| `llama3.2:3b` | 1.9 GB | ⚡ Fast | Both — best balance |
| `phi3:mini` | 2.3 GB | ⚡ Fast | Both — structured extraction |
| `gemma2:2b` | 1.6 GB | ⚡ Fast | Both — summarization |
| `mistral:7b` | 4.1 GB | ◑ Medium | Mac only — long documents |
| `moondream:1.8b` | 1.1 GB | ⚡ Fast | Both — image understanding |
| `llava:7b` | 4.7 GB | ◑ Medium | Mac only — images in PDFs |

### Downloading a new model
1. Click **Manage** in the sidebar
2. Go to **Browse & Download**
3. Filter by machine (Windows PC or Mac Mini M2) and purpose
4. Click **Download via Ollama**
5. Wait for the progress bar to complete
6. Click **Use Now**

## Performance Notes

### Windows PC (Lenovo M900)
- Uses CPU-only inference (no GPU)
- `llama3.2:1b` responds in 20-40 seconds
- `llama3.2:3b` responds in 40-90 seconds
- Models larger than 4B parameters will be very slow
- The app pre-loads the model into RAM on startup for faster first queries

### Mac Mini M2
- Uses Apple Metal GPU acceleration via Ollama
- `llama3.2:1b` responds in 2-5 seconds
- `llama3.2:3b` responds in 5-10 seconds
- `mistral:7b` responds in 10-20 seconds
- Significantly faster than Windows CPU mode

## How It Works (Technical)

1. **Document indexing** — when you click Reload, the app reads all PDF/DOCX files in parallel, splits them into overlapping text chunks, and builds a TF-IDF search index in memory
2. **Search** — when you ask a question, TF-IDF cosine similarity finds the 4 most relevant chunks
3. **Generation** — the relevant chunks are sent to the local Ollama AI model as context, and the answer streams back token by token
4. **Nothing leaves your machine** — the AI model runs inside Docker, documents stay in your local folder, no network calls are made after initial setup

## Folder Structure Explained

```
doc-chat/
├── Dockerfile          ← defines the Docker image (Ubuntu + Ollama + Python)
├── app.py              ← Flask web server + document indexing + AI chat logic
├── requirements.txt    ← Python packages installed inside Docker
├── README.md           ← this file
├── start-windows.bat   ← Windows automated launcher
├── start-mac.sh        ← Mac automated launcher
├── templates/
│   └── index.html      ← the entire web UI (chat + model manager)
└── scripts/
    └── start.sh        ← startup script that runs inside the container
```

---

## Troubleshooting

**Green dot not appearing / Ollama not ready**
Run `docker logs -f docs-chat` — if you see the model is still downloading, just wait.

**"No PDF or DOCX files found" after clicking Reload**
Make sure your files are in `C:\pdfs` (Windows) or `~/pdfs` (Mac) and click Reload again.

**Answers get cut off or truncated**
The model hit its token limit. Click the ■ Stop button and rephrase as a more specific question, or switch to a model with higher quality (e.g. `llama3.2:3b` instead of `1b`).

**Very slow responses on Windows**
Switch to `llama3.2:1b` in the Model Manager — it is the fastest model for CPU-only machines.

**Port 5000 already in use**
Change `5000:5000` to `5001:5000` in the docker run command, then open http://localhost:5001

**To completely reset and start fresh**
```cmd
docker rm -f docs-chat
docker rmi docs-chat:latest
docker volume rm ollama_models
```
Then run the launcher script again.
